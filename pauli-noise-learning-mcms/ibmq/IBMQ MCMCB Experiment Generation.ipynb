    "This notebook generates and runs an MCM-CB experiment on IBM Q cloud quantum processors. Running this requires an IBM Q account. This notebook is set up to generate a 4-qubit experiment with a single MCM and 3 idling qubits (as presented in the main text of \"Pauli Noise Learning for Mid-Circuit Measurements\"). It is readily adaptable to other system sizes (e.g. the 2-qubit example in the SM)"
